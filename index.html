                            <p>Hi! I'm Ryan Cornett, and I'm blessed to wear a few hats in life, though none as important as being a husband to BreAnne and father to two wonderful daughters.</p>

                            <p>Since October 2019, I've been blessed to serve as an elder at <a class="no-blue-link" href="manchesterbaptistchurch.org" target="_blank">Manchester Baptist Church</a>, a confessional, Southern Baptist church in eastern Kentucky. I teach, preach, plan and execute evangelistic efforts, structure the worship services, and lead the songs. I'm blessed to serve with some lovely people who love God and make sacrifices for the Kingdom!</p>

                            <p>Dear to my heart, of course, is hymn writing. I believe hymns have a unique way of blending rich theology with beautiful, memorable, singable music. My aim is to create songs that help people reflect on God's character, His Word, and His work in our lives. Writing hymns has been a way for me to worship, study, meditate on, and express the truths I hold dear. I pray they are used to glorify God and edify His people.</p>

                            <p>For fun, I'm a weekend homesteader, web developer, and ham radio enthusiast! I love to grow peppers to make hot sauce, forage walnuts, build sites as resources for the church, and use Morse code to see where my simple wire antenna in a tree can reach. (The furthest so far is Italy!)</p>

                            <p>My prayer is that some of the resources available here—whether a hymn about justification, or one about repentance; a Bible plan generator; or online audio Bible—will bless you and be useful in your walk with the Lord. Soli Deo Gloria!</p>
